The run_analysis.R script performs the data preparation, followed by 5 requires steps and 6th step used for final results

1.      Dataset Source
               Downloaded and then extracted from UCI HAR DataSet
2.      Assigning veriables to Data    
                features <- features.txt: 561 row n 2 cols
                selected from Database from accelerometer and gyroscope 3-axial raw signals tAcc-XYZ and tGyro-XYZ.
                
                activities  <- activities_labels.txt: 6 rows and 2 cols
                it is used when corresponding measurements were taken and its labels
                
                subject_test <- subject_test.txt: 2947 rows n 1 col.
                contains test data of 9/30 volunteer 
                
                x_test <- test/x_test.txt: 2947 rows n 561 cols.
                contain records
                y_test <- test/y_test.txt: 2947 rows n 1 col.
                contain test data of activities code labels
                
                subject_train <- test/x_train.txt: 7352 rows n 1 col.
                contain train data of 21/30 volunteer being observed
                
                x_train <- test/x_train.txt: 7352 rows n 561 cols.
                contain  the record of features train data
                y_train <- test/y_train.txt: 7352 rows n 1 col.
                contain train data of activities code labels
 
 3.     Merges the traning and the test sets to create one data set
                          
               X(10299 rows, 561 cols), created by using rbind() function by merging x_train and x_test
               Y(10299 rows, 1 col), created by using rbind() function by merging y_train and y_test
               Subject(10299 rows, 1 col), created by using rbind() function by merging subject_train and subject_test
               Merged_Data(10299 rows, 563 cols), created by using rbind() function by merging subject, Y and X  x 

4.     Extracts only the measurements on the mean n SD for each measurement
               TidtData(10299 rows n 88 cols) is creating by using Merged_Data, measuring mean n SD for each       
               measurement.

5.     Assigning the Activities a name in Data Set.
                
               All no in code cols of TidtData Replsaced with Activities taken fron second cols of activity   
                variable.    
                
6.     Labeling the DS with variable names

              Code cols in TidyData renamed into activities
              All Acc in col name replaced by Accelerometer
              All Gyro in col name replaced by Gyroscope
              All Mag in col name replaced by Magnitude
              All BodyBody in col name replaced by Body
              All characterstarted with f replaced by frequency and t by Time.
              
7.     Using step 4 of DS

             FinalData (180 rows n 88 cols) by summarizing TidyData taking the mean of each veriable for each 
             activity n each subject using group_by by subject n activity
             Export FinalData into GinalData.txt file.
