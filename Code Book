The run_analysis.R script performs the data preparation, followed by 5 requires steps and 6th step used for final results

1.      Dataset Source
               Downloaded and then extracted from UCI HAR DataSet
2.      Assigning veriables to Data    
                features <- features.txt: 561 row n 2 cols
                selected from Database from accelerometer and gyroscope 3-axial raw signals tAcc-XYZ and tGyro-XYZ.
                
                activities  <- activities_labels.txt: 6 rows and 2 cols
                it is used when corresponding measurements were taken and its labels
                
                subject_test <- subject_test.txt: 2947 rows n 1 col.
                contains test data of 9/30 volunteer 
                
                x_test <- test/x_test.txt: 2947 rows n 561 cols.
                contain records
                y_test <- test/y_test.txt: 2947 rows n 1 col.
                contain test data of activities code labels
                
                subject_train <- test/x_train.txt: 7352 rows n 1 col.
                contain train data of 21/30 volunteer being observed
                
                x_train <- test/x_train.txt: 7352 rows n 561 cols.
                contain  the record of features train data
                y_train <- test/y_train.txt: 7352 rows n 1 col.
                contain train data of activities code labels
 
 3.     Merges the traning and the test sets to create one data set
